This repository contains the public experiments, works 
in progress, and official blocks for Cinder from Ban 
the Rewind. Feel free to look around and contribute 
where you see fit.

The vast majority of this is Windows-only. XCode sample
projects are the most welcome addition to this codebase. 
However, anything which wraps a Windows-specific API or
requires DLL file won't work on Mac.

To implement these blocks, clone this repository and 
merge the contents into your Cinder root directory. That 
is, copy the contents of "blocks" from the repo into Cinder's
"blocks" folder on your system.
