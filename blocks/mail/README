This block proposes a mail namespace inside of Cinder
for handling all e-mail operations. It currently wraps
jwSMTP for sending e-mail.

This blocks while sending, allowing you to create a 
queue a messages and send them sequentially.  However, 
you might want to run the queue in a separate thread.

WISH LIST

- Sample project
- Receive mail

-----------------------------------------

NOTE TO WINDOWS DEVELOPERS

There's a well-known issue with including "Winsock.h" or 
Winsock2.h" after "Windows.h".  To use jwSMTP in Windows, 
simply include the block before you include anything from 
Cinder --or-- just add this at the top of your main 
application's header:

#define _WINSOCKAPI_

This will block "Windows.h" from including any Winsock*.h 
files before you want them.
