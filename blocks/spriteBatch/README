Those who have done 2D game development will likely be 
familiar with the idea of the sprite batch. This is a 2D sprite
batch system for Cinder. Sprites extend ci::Area, inheriting things
like quick resizing, collision detection, etc. The sprite batch 
manages the sprite through an ID system, and has a draw() method which
renders all sprites.
